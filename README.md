## R-extensions and embedding R in Perl

Houston R Users Group meeting on 2014-11-03

Slides are in the `slides/` directory.

My code for embedding R in Perl is available at [embedding-r-in-perl](https://github.com/zmughal/embedding-r-in-perl-experiment).
This also depends on my data frame implementation at [data-frame-experiment](https://github.com/zmughal/data-frame-experiment).
